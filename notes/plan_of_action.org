* Approach to take
- use the api to parse the data.
  Reference : https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-file-api.7.html
  Things to do :
  - [ ] Find out the things to query for
  - [ ] add support to write the query files when configuring the project
  - [ ] Parse the reply to load all the available targets
  - [ ] Add option to choose which target to build
  - [ ] Add option to run the target and output the data to a separate buffer

* CMAKE File API
- We can use client stateful api to generate the data we need to parse. The majore requirement to do that is to create a query.json file in the build directory in the path
  #+begin_src
<build-directory>/.cmake/api/v1/client-emacs-cmake-tools/query.json
  #+end_src

  here ~client-emacs-cmake-tools~ is the special identifier to not interfere with other clients
